# Typanion

> Static and runtime type assertion library with no dependencies

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/typanion.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/typanion.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/developed%20with-Yarn%202-blue)](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

## Installation

```
yarn add typanion
```

## Why

- Typanion can validate nested arbitrary data structures
- Typanion is type-safe; it uses [type predicates](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)
- Typanion allows you to derive types from your schemas
- Typanion can report detailed error reports

Compared to [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), Typanion has a better inference support for TypeScript + supports `isOneOf`. Its functional API makes it very easy to tree shake, which is another bonus (although the library isn't very large in itself).

## Documentation

Check the website for our documentation: [mael.dev/typanion](https://mael.dev/typanion/).

## Usage

First define a schema using the builtin operators:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
});
```

Then just call the schema to validate any `unknown` value:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);

if (isMovie(userData)) {
    console.log(userData.title);
}
```

Passing a second parameter allows you to retrieve detailed errors:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);
const errors: string[] = [];

if (!isMovie(userData, {errors})) {
    console.log(errors);
}
```

You can also apply coercion over the user input:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);
const coercions: Coercion[] = [];

if (isMovie(userData, {coercions})) {
    // Coercions aren't flushed by default
    for (const [p, op] of coercions) op();

    // All relevant fields have now been coerced
    // ...
}
```

You can derive the type from the schema and use it in other functions:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
});

type Movie = t.InferType<typeof isMovie>;

// Then just use your alias:
const printMovie = (movie: Movie) => {
    // ...
};
```

Schemas can be stored in multiple variables if needed:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isActor = t.isObject({
    name: t.isString();
});

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
    actors: t.isArray(isActor),
});
```
